KiCad
-----

- Edit Diode footprint to allow a larger solder area.

- Edit transistor (3904 and Mosfet) footprint to have a smaller solder area.

- Edit LED footprints to use some of the excess LEDs on hand

- Rotate connectors so wire leads come in from the board edge.

- Correct the error in the relay drive circuit where R28 and R29 should
  pull down the gate pin instead of connecting the source pin to ground.

- Add identifying labels to the ISP header.

- Edit 4.7uH inductor footprint so it has more overhang on the sides to
  allow easier soldering.


Software
--------

- Modify button code so turnout controls are two state toggle switches and
  BTNPLUS/BTNMINUS are push buttons.
